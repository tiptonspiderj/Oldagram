# Digital Business Card
This was a fun project for building a digital business card with links to my e-mail, LinkedIn profile, and my portfolio website.

## Description

A unique way of carrying a business card.  I can now just text a link to people and they will have most of my contact information.  Maybel later I will add my phone number to this project.

### Installing for Windows

You can make a clone of this repository and then extract all of the files into one folder.  From there, simply click on the "index.html" file and open it with your favorite web browser. 

### Dependencies

This project was made with React and Webpack as the compiler.  It also use npm to manage all of the dependencies required.  I would now recommend using Vite as the compiler instead of Webpack.  It's quicker than Webpack.  When you are developing a project, it makes a big difference in the amount of time spent waiting to update your changes as you progress through your project.
